# Result
:pushpin: On the Home page, in addition to the small texts divided on the page, a table with technical specifications was created and an image with interactive caption was inserted. At the top of the page, an interactive menu has been inserted which, when the mouse is moved over, shows the icon for that page. This interactive menu is reproduced on all pages, but only the icon corresponding to the current page remains fixed.
